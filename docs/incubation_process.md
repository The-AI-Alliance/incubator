# Incubation Process

The AI Alliance Incubator follows a structured process to help projects grow and achieve long-term success. The process consists of the following stages:

1. **Proposal Submission**: Projects submit a proposal to join the incubator. The proposal should include details about the project's goals, team, and alignment with the AI Alliance's mission.

2. **Initial Review**: The Incubator Committee reviews the proposal to assess its feasibility, technical merit, and potential impact.

3. **Admission**: If approved, the project is admitted to the incubator and assigned a mentor.

4. **Incubation Phase**: During this phase, the project receives support from the AI Alliance community, including mentorship, resources, and collaboration opportunities. The project is expected to meet specific milestones and demonstrate progress.

5. **Graduation Review**: Once the project has met the criteria for graduation, it undergoes a final review by the Incubator Committee.

6. **Graduation**: If approved, the project graduates from the incubator and becomes a top-level project within the AI Alliance.

### Graduation Criteria
To graduate from the incubator, a project must:
- Demonstrate a stable and active community.
- Show clear progress toward its stated goals.
- Have a sustainable governance model.
- Align with the AI Alliance's mission and values.
