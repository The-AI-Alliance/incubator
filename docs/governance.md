# Governance

The AI Alliance Incubator is governed by a set of policies and procedures designed to ensure transparency, fairness, and sustainability. Key aspects of the governance structure include:

### Incubator Committee
The Incubator Committee is responsible for reviewing project proposals, overseeing the incubation process, and making decisions about project graduation. The committee is composed of experienced members of the AI Alliance community.

### Mentorship
Each project in the incubator is assigned a mentor who provides guidance and support throughout the incubation process. Mentors are experienced contributors who help projects navigate challenges and achieve their goals.

### Community Involvement
The AI Alliance community plays a vital role in the incubator. Community members are encouraged to contribute to projects, provide feedback, and participate in governance decisions.

### Policies
- **Code of Conduct**: All participants in the incubator are expected to adhere to the AI Alliance's Code of Conduct.
- **Transparency**: Decisions and processes are documented and made available to the community.
- **Sustainability**: Projects are encouraged to adopt sustainable practices and governance models.
