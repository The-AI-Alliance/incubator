# How to Join the Incubator

The AI Alliance Incubator welcomes new projects that align with its mission to advance AI technologies in a collaborative and sustainable manner. If you have a project that you believe would benefit from incubation, follow these steps:

1. **Submit a Proposal**: Prepare a detailed proposal outlining your project's goals, scope, and alignment with the AI Alliance's mission. Include information about your team, current status, and plans for growth.

2. **Review Process**: The proposal will be reviewed by the Incubator Committee, which evaluates projects based on technical merit, community impact, and alignment with the AI Alliance's objectives.

3. **Approval**: If approved, your project will be admitted to the incubator. You will be assigned a mentor to guide you through the incubation process.

4. **Incubation**: During incubation, your project will receive support from the AI Alliance community, including access to resources, mentorship, and collaboration opportunities.

5. **Graduation**: Once your project meets the criteria for graduation, it will move out of incubation and become a top-level project within the AI Alliance.
